## Short description

### What's the problem?

We are considering a post lockdown scenario where we might have mass gatherings at particular places like super market, temples, gardens or any other point of interest. There could be alternate options for all of these places where the number of people visiting might be relatively low but the crowd might not be aware of those options and would end up being at one particular place in large number (For eg: crowd gathering at Phoenix Market City would be more when compared to any other malls because people are not aware of any other option with small crowd)


can come up with some technology like the mobile app, where we can distribute the crowd like if a person wants to visit Ganesh temple, at run time we can predict(we can discuss on this how to do it.) the crowd, if the one which he is planning to go has a lot of crowds, we can recommend him another temple of Ganesh. The same recommendation for essentials, public places, etc. We can let users have a review about the place like how COVID ready is this etc.
By having this technology, it helps people for social distancing.

### How can technology help?

We can have a mobile application to achieve the crowd distribution and also understand the number of users present at a particular location.

### The idea

The mobile application will help the user to decide which alternate place should they visit if in case the current selected location has large crowd.
